When cloning this repo, remember to:

1) Run bundle install
2) Run rake db:migrate
3) Run rake rb:seed

For #3, I have the Categories we put in the seed file during class, plus three Products to seed so the Brands dropdown in the navbar will not break. You will need to go in and edit those Products - I only included values for name and brand attributes.
